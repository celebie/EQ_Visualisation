# 2D/3D EQ Visualisation


Hi, everyone! <br>
Please enjoy the results of my first Processing project:

**2D presentation:** https://vimeo.com/170372421 <br>

**3D presentation:** https://vimeo.com/170781644

It's a minimalist EQ animation and yes, it's not the best on the market :blush:

**Instructions:** You can use it with any song (put the music file next to the .pde and name it 'music.mp3'), but it's only tuned for *Mike Oldfield - Nuclear*. I recommend to try out with that song for maximal enjoyment. 

TO-DO:
  - Adaptively adjusting the amplification to the sound intensity
  - Adjusting the proportion of frequency values

After these modifications, I hope it will work great with any song.
